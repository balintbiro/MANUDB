   abstract = {Transfer of mtDNA in the nuclear genome is usually regarded as a continued and dynamic process of forming numt-pseudogenes or numt-insertions. They can be regarded not only as a neutral polymorphism, but may be involved in oncogenesis, aging and genetic diseases. Experimental identification of numt-insertions arising de novo is limited due to the presence of numerous homology mtDNA constitutively existing in the nuclear genomes of eukaryotes. It is known that the chick nuclear DNA (nDNA) constitutively contains 12 numt-pseudogenes. We attempted to experimentally detect the formation of numt-insertions de novo in the nDNA of chick embryos (Gallus gallus) from the eggs exposed to X-rays. Free mtDNAs were removed from preparations of nDNA of liver embryos through double gel electrophoresis. Numt-inserts in nDNA of control and survival embryos (from irradiated eggs) were revealed by PCR using 11 pairs of primers flanking the region of mtDNA of about 300-400 bp. PCR analysis with nDNA of control group showed no presence of homology mtDNA amplified with selected primers. PCR assays of nDNA of eight embryos from irradiated eggs showed that nDNA of two embryos contained new sites of mtDNA. PCR amplification of 3 loci of mtDNA is stably detected in nDNA from one embryo and 4 loci of mtDNA in nDNA from another embryo. Sequencing of PCR amplicons synthesized on templates of these nDNA showed that their sequences are identical to mtDNA and accurately cover the sites of several genes and the site of mtDNA D-loop. Thus, the experimental results indicate that ionizing radiation can induce integration of mtDNA fragments in the nuclear genome, apparently, through the mechanism of nonhomologous end-joining repair of double-strand breaks of nDNA.},

   abstract = {There is an ongoing process in which mitochondrial sequences are being integrated into the nuclear genome. The importance of these sequences has already been revealed in cancer biology, forensic, phylogenetic studies and in the evolution of the eukaryotic genetic information. Human and numerous model organisms’ genomes were described from those sequences point of view. Furthermore, recent studies were published on the patterns of these nuclear localised mitochondrial sequences in different taxa. However, the results of the previously released studies are difficult to compare due to the lack of standardised methods and/or using few numbers of genomes. Therefore, in this paper our primary goal is to establish a uniform mining pipeline to explore these nuclear localised mitochondrial sequences. Our results show that the frequency of several repetitive elements is higher in the flanking regions of these sequences than expected. A machine learning model reveals that the flanking regions’ repetitive elements and different structural characteristics are highly influential during the integration process. In this paper, we introduce a general mining pipeline for all mammalian genomes. The workflow is publicly available and is believed to serve as a validated baseline for future research in this field. We confirm the widespread opinion, on - as to our current knowledge - the largest dataset, that structural circumstances and events corresponding to repetitive elements are highly significant. An accurate model has also been trained to predict these sequences and their corresponding flanking regions.},

   abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is predominantly maternally inherited in eukaryotes. Diverse molecular mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of strict maternal inheritance (SMI) of mtDNA have been described, but the evolutionary forces responsible for its predominance in eukaryotes remain to be elucidated. Exceptions to SMI have been reported in diverse eukaryotic taxa, leading to the prediction that several distinct molecular mechanisms controlling mtDNA transmission are present among the eukaryotes. We propose that these mechanisms will be better understood by studying the deviations from the predominating pattern of SMI. This minireview summarizes studies on eukaryote species with unusual or rare mitochondrial inheritance patterns, i.e., other than the predominant SMI pattern, such as maternal inheritance of stable heteroplasmy, paternal leakage of mtDNA, biparental and strictly paternal inheritance, and doubly uniparental inheritance of mtDNA. The potential genes and mechanisms involved in controlling mitochondrial inheritance in these organisms are discussed. The linkage between mitochondrial inheritance and sex determination is also discussed, given that the atypical systems of mtDNA inheritance examined in this minireview are frequently found in organisms with uncommon sexual systems such as gynodioecy, monoecy, or andromonoecy. The potential of deviations from SMI for facilitating a better understanding of a number of fundamental questions in biology, such as the evolution of mtDNA inheritance, the coevolution of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and, perhaps, the role of mitochondria in sex determination, is considerable.},

   abstract = {Background: NumtS (Nuclear MiTochondrial Sequences) are mitochondrial DNA sequences that, after stress events involving the mitochondrion, colonized the nuclear genome. Accurate mapping of NumtS avoids contamination during mtDNA PCR amplification, thus supplying reliable bases for detecting false heteroplasmies. In addition, since they commonly populate mammalian genomes (especially primates) and are polymorphic, in terms of presence/absence and content of SNPs, they may be used as evolutionary markers in intra- and inter-species population analyses.Results: The need for an exhaustive NumtS annotation led us to produce the Reference Human NumtS compilation, followed, as reported in this paper, by those for chimpanzee, rhesus macaque and mouse ones. Identification of NumtS inside the UCSC Genome Browser and their inter-species comparison required the design and the implementation of NumtS tracks, starting from the compilation data. NumtS retrieval through the UCSC Genome Browser, in the species examined, is now feasible at a glance.Conclusions: Analyses involving NumtS tracks, together with other genome element tracks publicly available at the UCSC Genome Browser, can provide deep insight into genome evolution and comparative genomics, thus improving studies dealing with the mechanisms that drove the generation of NumtS. In addition, the NumtS tracks constitute a useful tool in the design of mitochondrial DNA primers. © 2012 Calabrese et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

We analyzed the mitochondrial and plastid genomes and 45S nuclear ribosomal DNA (45S rDNA) for the cultivated potato (S. tuberosum, St), wild potato (S. commersonii, Sc), and their somatic hybrid (StSc). Complex genome components and structure, such as the hybrid form of 45S rDNA in StSc, unique plastome in Sc, and recombinant mitogenome were identified. However, the mitogenome exhibited dynamic multipartite structures in both species as well as in the somatic hybrid. In St, the mitogenome is 756,058 bp and is composed of five subgenomes ranging from 297,014 to 49,171 bp. In Sc, it is 552,103 bp long and is composed of two sub-genomes of 338,427 and 213,676 bp length. StSc has 447,645 bp long mitogenome with two subgenomes of length 398,439 and 49,206 bp. The mitogenome structure exhibited dynamic recombination mediated by tandem repeats; however, it contained highly conserved genes in the three species. Among the 35 protein-coding genes of the StSc mitogenome, 21 were identical for all the three species, and 12 and 2 were unique in Sc and St, respectively. The recombinant mitogenome might be derived from homologous recombination between both species during somatic hybrid development.},

In this context, we identified and analysed 166 bovine NUMT regions with a total length of 430 kbp, representing about 0.02% of the cattle nuclear genome. Copies of all mitochondrial regions were detected in the nuclear genome, with distinct degrees of sequence similarity to the mitogenome. Some NUMT regions include large mitogenome segments and show high similarity to the organelle genome sequence. NUMT regions are frequently modified by insertion of repetitive sequences and by sequence rearrangements. We confirmed the existence of 29 NUMT regions by PCR amplification using DNA from the cow (Dominette) which was used to generate the bovine genome reference sequence, ruling out the possibility that these NUMTs could be artifacts of the genome assembly. As there are NUMT regions with high similarity to the mitogenome, special care is needed when designing primers for mitochondrial DNA amplification. Our results can therefore be used to avoid co-amplification of bovine nuclear sequences similar to mitochondrial DNA.},

In humans, five different numts cause genetic disease and a dozen human loci are polymorphic for the presence of numts, underscoring the rapid rate at which mitochondrial sequences reach the nucleus over evolutionary time. In the laboratory and in nature, numts enter the nuclear DNA via non-homolgous end joining (NHEJ) at double-strand breaks (DSBs).

   abstract = {Background. The theory of Muller' Ratchet predicts that small asexual populations are doomed to accumulate ever-increasing deleterious mutation loads as a consequence of the magnified power of genetic drift and mutation that accompanies small population size. Evidence for Muller's Ratchet and knowledge on its underlying molecular mechanisms, however, are lacking for natural populations. Results. We characterized mitochondrial genome evolutionary processes in Caenorhabditis briggsae natural isolates to show that numerous lineages experience a high incidence of nonsynonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes and accumulate unusual deleterious noncoding DNA stretches with associated heteroplasmic function-disrupting genome deletions. Isolate-specific deletion proportions correlated negatively with nematode fecundity, suggesting that these deletions might negatively affect C. briggsae fitness. However, putative compensatory mutations were also observed that are predicted to reduce heteroplasmy levels of deleterious deletions. Paradoxically, compensatory mutations were observed in one major intraspecific C. briggsae clade where population sizes are estimated to be very small (and selection is predicted to be relatively weak), but not in a second major clade where population size estimates are much larger and selection is expected to be more efficient. Conclusion. This study provides evidence that the mitochondrial genomes of animals evolving in nature are susceptible to Muller's Ratchet, suggests that context-dependent compensatory mutations can accumulate in small populations, and predicts that Muller's Ratchet can affect fundamental evolutionary forces such as the rate of mutation. © 2008 Howe and Denver; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The difficulty is caused by the nonuniform (oligo)nucleotide composition of these sequences, rather than their size per se. To solve this problem, we modified the standard seed-and-extend approach (e.g., BLAST) to use adaptive seeds. Adaptive seeds are matches that are chosen based on their rareness, instead of using fixed-length matches. This method guarantees that the number of matches, and thus the running time, increases linearly, instead of quadratically, with sequence length.

A table is given showing the ratios thus found for different frequencies of advantageous mutations and different degrees of their advantage. It is shown that this calculation does not apply for mutant genes that act advantageously only when in some special combinations with one or more other mutant genes, and that as far as these cases of special synergism are concerned recombining lines have no evolutionary advantage over non-recombining ones. Other limitations of the formula are pointed out and assessed. It is explained that most factors that retard the rate of recombination-for expample, linkage, rarity of outbreeding, intercalation of sexual reproduction between more frequent cycles of sexual propagation, and partial isolation between subpopulations-must usually cause little long-term retardation of the speed of advance that is fostered by recombination. Moreover, even where long-term evolutions has virtually ceased, recombination of mutant genes still confers upon a population the means of adopting short-term genetic "dodges", that adjust it to ecological and "physical" changes in its circumstances, much more rapidly than would be possible for a comparable asexual population. Under conditions where only stability of type is needed, a non-recombining does not actually degenerate as a result of an excess of mutation over selection, after the usual equilibrium between these pressures is reached. However, a irreversible ratchet mechanism exists in the non-recombining species (unlike the recombining ones) that prevents selection, even if intensified, from reducing the mutational loads below the lightest that were in existence when the intensified selection started, whereas, contrariwise, "drift", and what might be called "selective noise" must allow occasional slips of the lightest loads in the direction of increased weight. © 1964.},

   abstract = {mtDNA sequences can be incorporated into the nuclear genome and produce nuclear mitochondrial fragments (NUMTs), which resemble mtDNA in their sequence but are transmitted biparentally, like the nuclear genome. NUMTs can be mistaken as real mtDNA and may lead to the erroneous impression that mtDNA is biparentally transmitted. Here, we report a case of mtDNA heteroplasmy in a Drosophila melanogaster DGRP line, in which the one haplotype was biparentally transmitted in an autosomal manner. Given the sequence identity of this haplotype with the mtDNA, the crossing experiments led to uncertainty about whether heteroplasmy was real or an artifact due to a NUMT. More specific experiments revealed that there is a large NUMT insertion in the X chromosome of a specific DGRP line, imitating biparental inheritance of mtDNA. Our result suggests that studies on mtDNA heteroplasmy and on mtDNA inheritance should first exclude the possibility of NUMT interference in their data.},

   abstract = {Both genomes in chloroplasts and mitochondria of plant cell are usually inherited from maternal parent, with rare exceptions. To characterize the inheritance patterns of the organelle genomes in cucumber (Cucumis sativus var. sativus), two inbred lines and their reciprocal F1 hybrids were analyzed using an next generation whole genome sequencing data. Their complete chloroplast genome sequences were de novo assembled, and a single SNP was identified between the parental lines. Two reciprocal F1 hybrids have the same chloroplast genomes with their maternal parents. Meanwhile, 292 polymorphic sites were identified between mitochondrial genomes of the two parental lines, which showed the same genotypes with their paternal parents in the two reciprocal F1 hybrids, without any recombination. The inheritance patterns of the chloroplast and mitochondria genomes were also confirmed in four additional cucumber accessions and their six reciprocal F1 hybrids using molecular markers derived from the identified polymorphic sites. Taken together, our results indicate that the cucumber chloroplast genome is maternally inherited, as is typically observed in other plant species, whereas the large cucumber mitochondrial genome is paternally inherited. The combination of DNA markers derived from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes will provide a convenient system for purity test of F1 hybrid seeds in cucumber breeding.},

   abstract = {We review the insertion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments into nuclear DNA (NUMTS) as a general and ongoing process that has occurred many times during genome evolution. Fragments of mtDNA are generated during the lifetime of organisms in both somatic and germinal cells, by the production of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria. The fragments are inserted into the nucleus during the double-strand breaks repair via the non-homologous end-joining machinery, followed by genomic instability, giving rise to the high variability observed in NUMT patterns among species, populations, or genotypes. Some de novo produced mtDNA insertions show harmful effects, being involved in human diseases, carcinogenesis, and ageing. NUMT generation is a non-stop process overpassing the Mendelian transmission. This parasitic property ensures their survival even against their harmful effects. The accumulation of mtDNA fragments mainly at pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions is important to understand the transmission and integration of NUMTs into the genomes. The possible effect of female meiotic drive for mtDNA insertions at centromeres remains to be studied. In spite of the harmful feature of NUMTs, they are important in cell evolution, representing a major source of genomic variation.},

The transferred mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments in the nuclear genome are called nuclear mtDNA or NUMTs. We have named the process numtogenesis, defining the term as the transfer of mtDNA into the nuclear genome, or, less specifically, the transfer of mitochondria or mitochondrial components into the nucleus. There is increasing evidence of the involvement of NUMTs in human biology and pathology. Although information pertaining to NUMTs and numtogenesis is sparse, the role of this aspect of mitochondrial biology to human cancers is apparent. In this review, we present available knowledge about the origin and mechanisms of numtogenesis, with special emphasis on the role of NUMTs in human malignancies. We describe studies undertaken in our laboratory and in others and discuss the influence of NUMTs in tumor initiation and progression and in survival of cancer patients. We describe suppressors of numtogenesis and evolutionary conserved mechanisms underlying numtogenesis in cancer. An understanding the emerging field of numtogenesis should allow comprehension of this process in various malignancies and other diseases and, more generally, in human health.},

   abstract = {Background: In contrast to most animal genomes, mitochondrial genomes in species belonging to the phylum Cnidaria show distinct variations in genome structure, including the mtDNA structure (linear or circular) and the presence or absence of introns in protein-coding genes. Therefore, the analysis of nuclear insertions of mitochondrial sequences (NUMTs) in cnidarians allows us to compare the NUMT content in animals with different mitochondrial genome structures.Results: NUMT identification in the Hydra magnipapillata, Nematostella vectensis and Acropora digitifera genomes showed that the NUMT density in the H. magnipapillata genome clearly exceeds that in other two cnidarians with circular mitochondrial genomes. We found that H. magnipapillata is an exceptional ancestral metazoan with a high NUMT cumulative percentage but a large genome, and its mitochondrial genome linearisation might be responsible for the NUMT enrichment. We also detected the co-transposition of exonic and intronic fragments within NUMTs in N. vectensis and provided direct evidence that mitochondrial sequences can be transposed into the nuclear genome through DNA-mediated fragment transfer. In addition, NUMT expression analyses showed that NUMTs are co-expressed with adjacent protein-coding genes, suggesting the relevance of their biological function.Conclusions: Taken together, our results provide valuable information for understanding the impact of mitochondrial genome structure on the interaction of mitochondrial molecules and nuclear genomes. © 2013 Song et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: Colorectal adenocarcinomas are characterized by abnormal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and genomic instability, but a molecular interaction between mitochondrial and nuclear genome remains unknown. Here we report the discovery of increased copies of nuclear mtDNA (NUMT) in colorectal adenocarcinomas, which supports link between mtDNA and genomic instability in the nucleus. We name this phenomenon of nuclear occurrence of mitochondrial component as numtogenesis. We provide a description of NUMT abundance and distribution in tumor versus matched blood-derived normal genomes. Methods: Whole-genome sequence data were obtained for colon adenocarcinoma and rectum adenocarcinoma patients participating in The Cancer Genome Atlas, via the Cancer Genomics Hub, using the GeneTorrent file acquisition tool. Data were analyzed to determine NUMT proportion and distribution on a genome-wide scale. A NUMT suppressor gene was identified by comparing numtogenesis in other organisms. Results: Our study reveals that colorectal adenocarcinoma genomes, on average, contains up to 4.2-fold more somatic NUMTs than matched normal genomes. Women colorectal tumors contained more NUMT than men. NUMT abundance in tumor predicted parallel abundance in blood. NUMT abundance positively correlated with GC content and gene density. Increased numtogenesis was observed with higher mortality. We identified YME1L1, a human homolog of yeast YME1 (yeast mitochondrial DNA escape 1) to be frequently mutated in colorectal tumors. YME1L1 was also mutated in tumors derived from other tissues. We show that inactivation of YME1L1 results in increased transfer of mtDNA in the nuclear genome. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates increased somatic transfer of mtDNA in colorectal tumors. Our study also reveals sex-based differences in frequency of NUMT occurrence and that NUMT in blood reflects NUMT in tumors, suggesting NUMT may be used as a biomarker for tumorigenesis. We identify YME1L1 as the first NUMT suppressor gene in human and demonstrate that inactivation of YME1L1 induces migration of mtDNA to the nuclear genome. Our study reveals that numtogenesis plays an important role in the development of cancer.},

   abstract = {Practices related to mitochondrial research have long been hindered by the presence of mitochondrial pseudogenes within the nuclear genome (NUMTs). Even though partially assembled human reference genomes like hg38 have included NUMTs compilation, the exhaustive NUMTs within the only complete reference genome (T2T-CHR13) remain unknown. Here, we comprehensively identified the fixed NUMTs within the reference genome using human pan-mitogenome (HPMT) from GeneBank. The inclusion of HPMT serves the purpose of establishing an authentic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutational spectrum for the identification of NUMTs, distinguishing it from the polymorphic variations found in NUMTs. Using HPMT, we identified approximately 10% of additional NUMTs in three human reference genomes under stricter thresholds. And we also observed an approximate 6% increase in NUMTs in T2T-CHR13 compared to hg38, including NUMTs on the short arms of chromosomes 13, 14, and 15 that were not assembled previously. Furthermore, alignments based on 20-mer from mtDNA suggested the presence of more mtDNA-like short segments within the nuclear genome, which should be avoided for short amplicon or cell free mtDNA detection. Finally, through the assay of transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) on cell lines before and after mtDNA elimination, we concluded that NUMTs have a minimal impact on bulk ATAC-seq, even though 16% of sequencing data originated from mtDNA},

Being able to robustly identify such foreign DNA is a crucial capability for health and biosecurity applications, such as anti-microbial resistance (AMR) detection or monitoring gene drives. This capability does not exist for poorly characterised host genomes or with limited information about the integrated sequence. To address this, we developed the INserted Sequence Information DEtectoR (INSIDER). INSIDER analyses whole genome sequencing data and identifies segments of potentially foreign origin by their significant shift in k-mer signatures. We demonstrate the power of INSIDER to separate integrated DNA sequences from normal genomic sequences on a synthetic dataset simulating the insertion of a CRISPR-Cas gene drive into wild-type yeast. As a proof-of-concept, we use INSIDER to detect the exact AMR plasmid in whole genome sequencing data from a Citrobacter freundii patient isolate. INSIDER streamlines the process of identifying integrated DNA in poorly characterised wild species or when the insert is of unknown origin, thus enhancing the monitoring of emerging biosecurity threats.},

   abstract = {It is well known that remnants of partial or whole copies of mitochondrial DNA, known as Nuclear MiTochondrial sequences (NUMTs), are found in nuclear genomes. Since whole genome sequences have become available, many bioinformatics studies have identified putative NUMTs and from those attempted to infer the factors involved in NUMT creation. These studies conclude that NUMTs represent randomly chosen regions of the mitochondrial genome. There is less consensus regarding the nuclear insertion sites of NUMTs - previous studies have discussed the possible role of retrotransposons, but some recent ones have reported no correlation or even anti-correlation between NUMT sites and retrotransposons. These studies have generally defined NUMT sites using BLAST with default parameters. We analyze a redefined set of human NUMTs, computed with a carefully considered protocol. We discover that the inferred insertion points of NUMTs have a strong tendency to have high-predicted DNA curvature, occur in experimentally defined open chromatin regions and often occur immediately adjacent to A + T oligomers. We also show clear evidence that their flanking regions are indeed rich in retrotransposons. Finally we show that parts of the mitochondrial genome D-loop are under-represented as a source of NUMTs in primate evolution. © 2012 The Author(s).},

Here we analyse whole-genome sequences from 66,083 people—including 12,509 people with cancer—and demonstrate the ongoing transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nucleus, contributing to a complex NUMT landscape. More than 99% of individuals had at least one of 1,637 different NUMTs, with 1 in 8 individuals having an ultra-rare NUMT that is present in less than 0.1% of the population. More than 90% of the extant NUMTs that we evaluated inserted into the nuclear genome after humans diverged from apes. Once embedded, the sequences were no longer under the evolutionary constraint seen within the mitochondrion, and NUMT-specific mutations had a different mutational signature to mitochondrial DNA. De novo NUMTs were observed in the germline once in every 104 births and once in every 103 cancers. NUMTs preferentially involved non-coding mitochondrial DNA, linking transcription and replication to their origin, with nuclear insertion involving multiple mechanisms including double-strand break repair associated with PR domain zinc-finger protein 9 (PRDM9) binding. The frequency of tumour-specific NUMTs differed between cancers, including a probably causal insertion in a myxoid liposarcoma. We found evidence of selection against NUMTs on the basis of size and genomic location, shaping a highly heterogenous and dynamic human NUMT landscape.},

   abstract = {Nuclear-mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs) are mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragments that have been inserted into the nuclear genome. Some NUMTs are common within the human population but most NUMTs are rare and specific to individuals. NUMTs range in size from 24 base pairs to encompassing nearly the entire mtDNA and are found throughout the nuclear genome. Emerging evidence suggests that the formation of NUMTs is an ongoing process in humans. NUMTs contaminate sequencing results of the mtDNA by introducing false positive variants, particularly heteroplasmic variants present at a low variant allele frequency (VAF). In our review, we discuss the prevalence of NUMTs in the human population, the potential mechanisms of de novo NUMT insertion via DNA repair mechanisms, and provide an overview of the existing approaches for minimizing NUMT contamination. Apart from filtering known NUMTs, both wet lab-based and computational methods can be used to minimize the contamination of NUMTs in analyses of human mtDNA. Current approaches include: (1) isolating mitochondria to enrich for mtDNA; (2) applying basic local alignment to identify NUMTs for subsequent filtering; (3) bioinformatic pipelines for NUMT detection; (4) k-mer-based NUMT detection; and (5) filtering candidate false positive variants by mtDNA copy number, VAF, or sequence quality score. Multiple approaches must be applied in order to effectively identify NUMTs in samples. Although next-generation sequencing is revolutionizing our understanding of heteroplasmic mtDNA, it also raises new challenges with the high prevalence and individual-specific NUMTs that need to be handled with care in studies of mitochondrial genetics.},
