        <p>
            MANUDB is a database that stores mitchondrial sequences of mammalian species that are integrated into the nuclear genome.
            These sequences are called NUMTs. NUMTs turned out to be quite important in cancer biology, phylogenetic and forensic studies.
            Human and numerous model organismsâ€™ genomes were described from the NUMTs point of view.
            However, the results of the previously released studies are difficult to compare due to the lack of standardised methods and/or using few numbers of genomes.
            Our team has already established and published the computational pipeline to mine NUMTs.
            Therefore, with MANUDB our primary goal is to store, visualize and make accessible the NUMTs that were extracted by our workflow.

        <p>
            MANUDB was created by aligning the corresponding mitochondrial and nuclear (top level) genome sequences with the LASTAL software. 
            The sequence files are from the NCBI database.
            The exact steps were discussed in different papers.
            Right now, MANUDB contains NUMTs from 153 mammalian genomes, however the size of the database is continously growing with new species and new functionalities are also being added.

        <p>
            MANUDB right now supports searching, visualizing and exporting of species specific datasets of NUMTs.
